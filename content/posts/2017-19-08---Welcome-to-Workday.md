# Workday Overview

Where is your personal information, such as your address, hire date, job information, and compensation amount, currently
stored at your company? Is it on a computer server?

Is it in a file cabinet? Maybe you do not know.

Now with the deployment of Workday, your organization has decided to move your data into the cloud. The cloud is a secure way to store information without any hardware at your location, so you can access it from the Internet.

Companies use Workday for many reasons. One reason is because they may be trying to save paper! Before systems like Workday existed, workers had to fill out paper forms, and managers or executives would sign off on the forms to approve them. With Workday, paper is a thing of the past.

Workday allows you to submit requests electronically, and routes them to your manager or other appropriate party for approval. For example, if you move, you can let your company know your address has changed by editing it in Workday.

Your company has configured the tasks you can do in the system so they will automatically route to the appropriate person or group of people who needs to approve or be made aware of the change. Workday keeps an audit trail in the system so you can go back and view the status of your request at any time.

Another reason why your company chose Workday is because it provides data in real time. Your executives can make key business decisions, such as how many people to hire or how much to spend on business operations, with accurate and up-to-date information. These reports are also valuable to auditors who may need to ensure your company is complying with current laws.

To access Workday, you will receive a link to Workday that is specific to your company. You will receive a user name and password and will be able to log into your Workday homepage, which will contain information that your organization stores about you and your job.

When you log in, you will see circular icons. These are called worklets. You can click on a worklet to access tasks and reports. For example, if you click on the “Personal information” worklet, you can click on a task like “Change Contact Information” or a report like “View About Me.” 

Another way to navigate within Workday is to use the search bar. Workday was built using a unique object oriented technology. Each object in workday, such as a person, is tied to other objects. Each worker in the system has many objects attached to them.

You may be asking, why does the object technology matter to me? It is because it makes Workday easy to use! You can click on the related action button next to any object in the system and see a list of tasks you can do that are related to that object.

In addition, to make the system as easy to use as possible, Workday can be accessed from other devices besides your computer. This ensures you always have convenient access to Workday at anytime, anywhere. If you are a manager, you will have the ability to review and approve requests even when you are away from your desk.

You are joining over 2 million workers around the world who use Workday. You are going to be using the next generation
of enterprise business software!

Welcome to Workday!
