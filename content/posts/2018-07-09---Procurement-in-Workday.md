# Workday Procurement

Procurement involves the process of selecting vendors, establishing payment terms, selection, the negotiation of contracts and actual purchasing of goods. Procurement is concerned with acquiring (procuring) all the goods, services, and work that is vital to an organization. Procurement is key part of the company strategy. it includes preparation, process of demand, end receipt approval for payments. 

Workday addresses the unique requirements of both goods and services spend and doesn't require you to deploy multiple systems to manage it. From requisition to payment, Workday Procurement provides a single system for the procure-to-pay process and is built for today's global businesses

## Steps of the Procure to Pay (P2P) Cycle:

- The process begins with planning what materials are required, when they are required, and the price that the company can afford to pay for them.

- Then the company prepares a list of vendors that they think can provide the materials for them.
- The company asks each of the vendors to submit a quotation, which includes the price, terms of delivery, quality of materials, and any other information that they need for making their decision. This stage could also involve negotiating with the vendors for the best deal.

- Once a vendor has been chosen, the buyers create a purchase requisition form that includes information such as the description of goods and services, department account number, signatures of the authorized managers, delivery instructions and quotation from the authorized vendor.

- A formal purchase order is sent to the vendor to supply the goods along with instructions as to the conditions under which they have to be supplied.

- Once the company receives the goods from the supplier, the purchase department prepares a Goods Receipt. This is an important document which can later be used for reconciling if what the seller delivered was indeed what they asked for.

- The Goods Receipt is compared with the Purchase Order to validate if the two matches. If there are any discrepancies, the buyer can contact the seller and post a complaint. Checks are made if the goods are suitable for use or not, if the correct quantity has been delivered, if all the goods meet the ordered specifications, and they are priced according to the terms of the purchase order. If any goods are damaged, then the buyers will have to contact the sellers and ask either for a replacement or a refund.

- Once the verification of the goods is done, the payment invoice is created and the necessary approvals from the project managers are obtained.
- When the company makes the final payments to the vendor, the cycle ends.
